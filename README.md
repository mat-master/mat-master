# Mat Master

The SaaS app for martial arts schools and fitness studios to manage students/members, billing, attendance, and more.

## Setting Up
Requires the following build tools for most projects
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

We implement the Yarn Package Manager so install it globally
```
$ npm install -g yarn
```

Then run the following in the root of the project
```
$ yarn install
```

You should then be free to enter into any project and run
```
$ yarn dev
```

**Extra tooling is required for the [API](https://github.com/mat-master/mat-master/tree/main/microservices/api)**
